# 🧠 Python Workbook: Keywords, Variables & Naming Conventions

# ✅ Exercise 1: Declare Variables
# Declare variables for your name, age, and country. Print them.

# Example:
# name = "Alice"
# age = 30
# country = "India"

# ✅ Exercise 2: Valid vs Invalid Variables
# Identify which of the following variable names are valid or invalid, and correct the invalid ones.

# 2user = "John"
# my-name = "Jane"
# _score = 99
# class = "Math"
# totalPrice = 150

# ✅ Exercise 3: Arithmetic with Variables
# Declare two numbers and print their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

# ✅ Exercise 4: Use Boolean Variables
# Create a boolean variable `is_logged_in` and set it to True. Print a message if the user is logged in.

# ✅ Exercise 5: Combine Strings
# Create variables `first_name` and `last_name`. Print the full name by combining them.

# ✅ Exercise 6: Constants
# Declare a constant for PI as 3.14 using UPPER_CASE naming. Print the area of a circle with radius 5.

# ✅ Exercise 7: Keyword Error
# Try creating a variable with a Python keyword like `if = 5`. What error do you get?

# ✅ Exercise 8: Temperature Conversion
# Create a variable for temperature in Celsius. Convert and print in Fahrenheit.
# Formula: F = (C * 9/5) + 32

# ✅ Exercise 9: Type Checking
# Declare different types of variables (int, float, str, bool) and print their types using `type()`.

# ✅ Exercise 10: Naming Convention Practice
# Rewrite the following variables using proper naming:
# 1. UserName -> ?
# 2. userAge -> ?
# 3. current-location -> ?
# 4. ISVALID -> ?
# 5. AccountBalance -> ?

# 🎯 Bonus: Create a mini program that asks for the user's name and age, then prints a greeting.
