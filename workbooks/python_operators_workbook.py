# 1️⃣ Arithmetic Operators
# Q1. Write a program that calculates the sum, difference, product, and quotient of two numbers.

a = 15
b = 4

# Write code here


# 2️⃣ Comparison Operators
# Q2. Compare two numbers and print if they are equal or not.

x = 10
y = 20

# Write code here


# 3️⃣ Assignment Operators
# Q3. Start with a = 5 and use +=, *=, -= to update its value step by step.

a = 5

# Write code here


# 4️⃣ Logical Operators
# Q4. Check if a number is between 10 and 50 using logical operators.

num = 30

# Write code here


# 5️⃣ Bitwise Operators
# Q5. Apply bitwise AND, OR, and XOR on two integers.

m = 6   # 110
n = 3   # 011

# Write code here


# 6️⃣ Membership Operators
# Q6. Check if a character is in a given string.

text = "Python Programming"

# Write code here


# 7️⃣ Identity Operators
# Q7. Use identity operators to compare two lists.

list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]

# Write code here


# 8️⃣ Combined Operators
# Q8. Combine arithmetic, assignment and comparison in a small program.

# Write a program where you take a number, double it, and check if it is greater than 50


# 9️⃣ Logical + Membership
# Q9. Write a program that checks if a word contains the letter 'p' and length > 5

word = "python"

# Write code here


# 🔟 Bonus: Interactive
# Q10. Ask user to input a number and tell if it's even or odd using modulus operator.

# Uncomment the below lines when running in interactive mode
# num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# Write code here
